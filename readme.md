## My [vim][1] config files

Primarily I use MacVim, so gvimrc is basically specialized for it.
Certainly I use [pathogen][3] as a glue, it's just the key to the rescue. The main upadte script is [vim-upadte-bundles][2]. The list of plugins can be found in [bundle][4] direcory.

Many thanks to people from [vim-scripts][5], for their github repo with all the scripts. Now we can use submodules for all my plugins \\^\_\^/
